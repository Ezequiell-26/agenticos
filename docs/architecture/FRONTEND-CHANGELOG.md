## Baseline — 2026-09-23

The current repository already contains an early desktop UI from existing commits. This entry documents the baseline without changing its verification status.

### Existing Tauri/React/Vite surface
- Existing commit: `72ce3413693531b2e1c67c33152fe41a00897144`
- Existing work: Tauri 2 desktop shell, React + TypeScript + Vite frontend, basic chat/status/history components, Windows build foundation.
- Status: preserved; not reclassified as verified by this architecture operation.

### Existing Tailwind setup
- Existing commit: `bf3c919149d0c32589742840c27b330ff56587fa`
- Existing work: Tailwind CSS/PostCSS/Autoprefixer added to the desktop frontend.
- Status: preserved; not reclassified as verified by this architecture operation.

### Current architecture operation
- Authorized purpose: architecture/governance reconciliation and persistent frontend guidance.
- User-visible effect: no runtime UI behavior intentionally changed.
- Created: canonical architecture docs, frontend contract, local AI skills/playbooks, frontend verification gate.
- Modified: project-state/implementation-state/CI documentation and continuity controls.
- Deleted: none.
- Verification: static repository evidence only; CI for this new branch remains required before merge.
- Unverified: current runtime/build state on Windows and browser visual state.
- Rollback: branch base `bf3c919149d0c32589742840c27b330ff56587fa`.
- Next step: continue the single authorized implementation step recorded by `reference/manifests/implementation-state.json`.
