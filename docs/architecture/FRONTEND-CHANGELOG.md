# AgentiCOS — Frontend Change Log

Append-only log for user-visible frontend changes and frontend architecture changes.

## Entry format

Every entry must contain:

- date;
- authorized implementation step;
- commit/PR;
- files changed;
- user-visible effect;
- architecture decision, if any;
- verification evidence;
- unverified checks;
- rollback point;
- exactly one next step.

## Baseline — 2026-09-23

The current repository already contains an early desktop UI from existing commits. This entry documents the baseline without changing its verification status.

### Existing Tauri/React/Vite surface
- Existing commit: `72ce3413693531b2e1c67c33152fe41a00897144`
- Existing work: Tauri 2 desktop shell, React + TypeScript + Vite frontend, basic chat/status/history components, Windows build foundation.
- Status: preserved; not reclassified as verified by this architecture operation.

### Existing Tailwind setup
- Existing commit: `bf3c919149d0c32589742840c27b330ff56587fa`
- Existing work: Tailwind CSS/PostCSS/Autoprefixer added to the desktop frontend.
- Status: preserved; not reclassified as verified by this architecture operation.

### Current architecture operation
- Authorized purpose: architecture/governance reconciliation and persistent frontend guidance.
- User-visible effect: no runtime UI behavior intentionally changed.
- Created: canonical architecture docs, frontend contract, local AI skills/playbooks, frontend verification gate.
- Modified: project-state/implementation-state/CI documentation and continuity controls.
- Deleted: none.
- Verification: static repository evidence only; CI for this new branch remains required before merge.
- Unverified: current runtime/build state on Windows and browser visual state.
- Rollback: branch base `bf3c919149d0c32589742840c27b330ff56587fa`.
- Next step: continue the single authorized implementation step recorded by `reference/manifests/implementation-state.json`.

## Command Center — 2026-09-24

- Authorized purpose: begin the requested premium desktop frontend slice while preserving the existing Rust-first runtime boundary.
- Branch: `feature/frontend-command-center`.
- User-visible effect: replaced the minimal prototype shell with a black/white command-center workspace featuring activity navigation, conversation explorer, agent panel, chat surface, runtime status bar and searchable command palette.
- Created:
  - typed runtime contracts in `src/types/runtime.ts`;
  - transport/service boundary in `src/services/runtime.ts`;
  - reusable icon and navigation primitives;
  - `CommandPalette` for workspace search and keyboard command access.
- Modified:
  - `src/App.tsx`;
  - `src/index.css`;
  - existing frontend components to use typed props and reusable primitives.
- Deleted: none.
- Preserved: legacy components remain in the repository history and were not destructively removed.
- Architecture decision: leaf UI components do not call provider APIs directly. Known current runtime endpoints are isolated behind `AgenticosRuntime`; no unsupported backend route was invented.
- Verification evidence: TypeScript/build and browser verification are pending for this branch; existing frontend architecture gate remains the baseline contract.
- Unverified checks: Windows/Tauri runtime, live backend availability, browser visual state, production CSP/Tauri permissions.
- Rollback point: `3e9e9358f438c1e028eb350921ae072b86696083`.
- Next step: run frontend typecheck/build and interactive browser verification for the Command Center branch.
