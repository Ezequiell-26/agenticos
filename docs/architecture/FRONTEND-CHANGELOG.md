## Baseline — 2026-09-23

The current repository already contains an early desktop UI from existing commits. This entry documents the baseline without changing its verification status.

### Existing Tauri/React/Vite surface
- Existing commit: `72ce3413693531b2e1c67c33152fe41a00897144`
- Existing work: Tauri 2 desktop shell, React + TypeScript + Vite frontend, basic chat/status/history components, Windows build foundation.
- Status: preserved; not reclassified as verified by this architecture operation.

### Existing Tailwind setup
- Existing commit: `bf3c919149d0c32589742840c27b330ff56587fa`
- Existing work: Tailwind CSS/PostCSS/Autoprefixer added to the desktop frontend.
- Status: preserved; not reclassified as verified by this architecture operation.

### Current architecture operation
- Authorized purpose: architecture/governance reconciliation and persistent frontend guidance.
- User-visible effect: no runtime UI behavior intentionally changed.
- Created: canonical architecture docs, frontend contract, local AI skills/playbooks, frontend verification gate.
- Modified: project-state/implementation-state/CI documentation and continuity controls.
- Deleted: none.
- Verification: static repository evidence only; CI for this new branch remains required before merge.
- Unverified: current runtime/build state on Windows and browser visual state.
- Rollback: branch base `bf3c919149d0c32589742840c27b330ff56587fa`.
- Next step: continue the single authorized implementation step recorded by `reference/manifests/implementation-state.json`.

## Command Center — 2026-09-24

- Authorized purpose: begin the requested premium desktop frontend slice while preserving the existing Rust-first runtime boundary.
- Branch: `feature/frontend-command-center`.
- User-visible effect: replaced the minimal prototype shell with a black/white command-center workspace featuring activity navigation, conversation explorer, agent panel, chat surface, runtime status bar and searchable command palette.
- Created:
  - typed runtime contracts in `src/types/runtime.ts`;
  - transport/service boundary in `src/services/runtime.ts`;
  - reusable icon and navigation primitives;
  - `CommandPalette` for workspace search and keyboard command access.
- Modified:
  - `src/App.tsx`;
  - `src/index.css`;
  - existing frontend components to use typed props and reusable primitives.
- Deleted: none.
- Preserved: legacy components remain in the repository history and were not destructively removed.
- Architecture decision: leaf UI components do not call provider APIs directly. Known current runtime endpoints are isolated behind `AgenticosRuntime`; no unsupported backend route was invented.
- Verification evidence: TypeScript/build and browser verification are pending for this branch; existing frontend architecture gate remains the baseline contract.
- Unverified checks: Windows/Tauri runtime, live backend availability, browser visual state, production CSP/Tauri permissions.
- Rollback point: `3e9e9358f438c1e028eb350921ae072b86696083`.
- Next step: run frontend typecheck/build and interactive browser verification for the Command Center branch.


## Command Center follow-up — 2026-09-24

- Authorized purpose: continue the premium frontend after merging the Command Center slice into main.
- Commit/PR: PR #20 merged as 988cc8b3a3c18089a22367147e5239ad13f7b28; follow-up hardening commits were applied directly to main.
- User-visible effect: added usable Files, Runs, Providers and Settings surfaces; persisted the last UI mode/session locally; added keyboard navigation to the command palette; exposed truthful runtime online/offline status; refined responsive provider layout and focus states.
- Created:
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/FileExplorer.tsx;
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/ProviderDashboard.tsx;
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/RunTimeline.tsx.
- Modified:
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/App.tsx;
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/WorkspaceOverview.tsx;
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/WorkspaceSidebar.tsx;
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/AgentPanel.tsx;
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/CommandPalette.tsx;
  - crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/index.css;
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- Deleted: none.
- Preserved: existing legacy frontend components, runtime contracts, Rust runtime, provider implementation and historical evidence.
- Architecture decision: UI persistence is limited to non-sensitive presentation state. Provider credentials, model discovery, telemetry and run execution remain runtime-owned. Preview surfaces are explicitly labeled until live contracts exist.
- Verification evidence: GitHub accepted all direct main writes; frontend CI was strengthened to run nested npm ci and the real Vite production build.
- Unverified checks: latest main CI result after these changes, browser visual verification, Windows/Tauri runtime verification, live backend integration for provider/run surfaces.
- Rollback point: 988cc8b3a3c18089a22367147e5239ad13f7b28.
- Next step: evaluate the latest main CI run and record evidence without advancing Step 25 verification state.

## Product Studio expansion — 2026-09-24

- Scope: frontend-only product surface expansion; backend connectivity intentionally does not block visual or interaction work.
- User-visible effect: expanded the desktop shell from five navigation views to a broader AI IDE surface with Files & Editor, Terminal, Runs, Workflows, Artifacts, Providers & Models, Skills, Tools, Memory and Settings.
- Created: `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/StudioSurface.tsx`.
- Modified: `ActivityRail.tsx`, `CommandPalette.tsx`, `WorkspaceOverview.tsx`, `App.tsx`, and `index.css`.
- Functionality added: local editor tabs and editing, diff preview, file filtering, run filtering/detail preview, provider selection, model search, skill/tool switches, memory pinning, workflow simulation, artifact selection/actions, terminal command simulation, settings toggles, notifications/toasts, expanded command search and keyboard navigation.
- Deleted: none.
- Preserved: existing chat/runtime integration, legacy components and repository history.
- Visual direction: monochrome black/white desktop IDE with dense engineering information hierarchy, hover/focus states, modal command palette, panes, tables, cards and responsive fallbacks.
- Verification evidence: GitHub writes accepted on `main`; CI run 654 was triggered from the frontend style commit and remained pending at the time of this entry.
- Unverified checks: final CI conclusion, browser screenshot verification, Windows/Tauri rendering, production accessibility audit.
- Rollback point: `988cc8b3a3c18089a22367147e5239ad13f7b28`.
- Next step: continue expanding high-value frontend surfaces while keeping all non-connected actions explicitly in preview/local state.

## Chat Surface expansion — 2026-09-24

- Scope: frontend-only interaction and visual polish.
- User-visible effect: upgraded chat into a richer agent workspace with model selector, attachment chips, composer tools, Web/Deep toggles, context chips, starter prompt grid and response actions.
- Modified: `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/ChatSurface.tsx`, `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/index.css`.
- Deleted: none.
- Preserved: chat runtime service boundary and all existing conversation behavior.
- Architecture decision: all new chat controls use presentation-local state until corresponding runtime contracts are intentionally introduced.
- Verification evidence: GitHub accepted the targeted frontend commits on `main`; CI was automatically triggered for the latest frontend commit.
- Unverified checks: latest CI conclusion, browser visual verification, Windows/Tauri rendering, accessibility audit.
- Rollback point: `4c035ecac4cff82cb08ff07790d20c22afb70099`.
- Next step: continue the frontend with richer approvals, observability and agent-control surfaces.

## Control & observability expansion — 2026-09-24

- Scope: frontend-only product expansion.
- User-visible effect: added Approvals, Observability, Agent Profiles and Prompt Lab to the main navigation and command palette.
- Modified: `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/ActivityRail.tsx`, `CommandPalette.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `StudioSurface.tsx`, and `index.css`.
- Functionality added: approval queue/detail actions, telemetry cards/event stream, selectable agent profiles with local controls, prompt library/editor/variables, richer navigation grouping and keyboard access.
- Deleted: none.
- Preserved: all previous chat, editor, run, provider, skills, tools, memory, workflow, artifact, terminal and settings surfaces.
- Architecture decision: these features are fully interactive in presentation-local state and are not represented as live backend telemetry or permissions until contracts exist.
- Verification evidence: GitHub accepted the frontend changes on `main`; CI was triggered automatically for the latest commits.
- Unverified checks: latest CI conclusion, browser visual verification, Windows/Tauri rendering, accessibility audit.
- Rollback point: `4c035ecac4cff82cb08ff07790d20c22afb70099`.
- Next step: continue with richer workspace interactions and visual regression coverage.

## Configuration + Chat controls expansion — 2026-09-24

- Scope: frontend-only, maximizing visible configuration and chat tooling without requiring backend contracts.
- Created: `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/SettingsSurface.tsx`.
- Modified: `StudioSurface.tsx`, `ChatSurface.tsx`, `ActivityRail.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `WorkspaceSidebar.tsx`, and `index.css`.
- Configuration sections added: General, Appearance, Editor, Chat, Agent, Tools, Safety, Context, Notifications, Privacy, Keyboard and Advanced.
- Configuration controls added: theme, density, font size, language, default model, default agent, context strategy, autosave, notifications, sound, motion, transparency, line numbers, word wrap, format-on-save, minimap, streaming, web-by-default, memory/draft persistence, creativity, autonomy, tool budget, tool visibility, confirmation policy, telemetry, crash reports, keymap, safety mode and advanced runtime/UI indicators.
- Chat controls added: agent selector, model selector, context scope, effort level, max output, temperature, Deep/Code/Web/Memory toggles, attachment strip, token estimate, tool picker, controls panel, richer starter prompts and response actions.
- Functionality is local/preview state and does not claim runtime permissions, provider telemetry or live model capability.
- Deleted: none.
- Preserved: existing chat integration, runtime service boundary, Product Studio surfaces and repository history.
- Verification evidence: GitHub accepted the frontend commits on `main`; CI run 676 was triggered from the cleanup commit.
- Unverified checks: latest CI conclusion, browser visual verification, Tauri/Windows rendering, accessibility audit.
- Rollback point: `60e0bdac13fe8ac5072a891abf4b0271fc67e215`.
- Next step: continue frontend-only work with richer side panels, previews, command surfaces and visual regression coverage.



## Cursor + Hermes frontend platform integration — 2026-09-24

- Scope: frontend-only integration of documented Cursor/Hermes-style product capabilities into the existing AgentiCOS desktop experience.
- User-visible effect: expanded navigation from the existing Studio views into a complete agent workspace covering project orchestration, codebase indexing, explicit context packs, rules/instructions, background agents, review/Bugbot workflows, checkpoints, specialist bot teams, automations, gateway channels, browser control, voice/media, research batches, MCP servers and a dedicated security center.
- Created:
  - `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/navigation.ts` as the single navigation/type registry.
  - `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/ChatEnhancementDock.tsx` for context references, slash-style commands, background/checkpoint/branch actions and response-format controls.
  - `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/features/platform/PlatformSurface.tsx` as the feature-oriented platform surface for the newly added domains.
  - `docs/architecture/FRONTEND-PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE.md` as the durable structure/contract map.
- Modified:
  - `App.tsx`, `ActivityRail.tsx`, `CommandPalette.tsx`, `WorkspaceOverview.tsx`, `ChatSurface.tsx`, `Icon.tsx`, `index.css`.
- Architecture decision:
  - navigation metadata is centralized to prevent drift between rail, command palette and application state;
  - new product domains live under `features/platform` rather than expanding the existing Studio monolith;
  - presentation-only controls are explicitly preview/local and do not claim live backend permissions, model telemetry, cloud execution or messaging delivery;
  - existing runtime service contracts remain the only live integration path.
- Reference basis: current public Cursor documentation/product material on Agent/Cloud Agents, codebase indexing, Rules, agent security and memories; current public Hermes documentation on tools/toolsets, skills, persistent memory, context files, checkpoints, cron, delegation, browser, voice, MCP and multi-platform gateway.
- Verification evidence:
  - frontend code committed to `main` in `8b8d134ec1a50d3f60f1cbc82ae5edbd329962f7`;
  - platform type-guard hardening committed in `9379aa4cd577f200dafbc9e919a1809b9245c22d`;
  - GitHub Actions run `#681` is the current CI run for `main` and was `in_progress` when this entry was recorded.
- Unverified checks: final CI conclusion, browser visual verification, Windows/Tauri rendering, accessibility audit and real backend contract integration for new surfaces.
- Rollback point: `19bc9d373dba412d45a021c193268a82159cf526`.
- Next step: inspect the latest CI result and use browser-level verification on the new navigation and highest-value platform views before introducing live contracts.


## Platform build hardening — 2026-09-24

- Scope: repair and verification hardening after the Cursor + Hermes platform expansion.
- Commit: `5f29373c3dd800c8deb60ee3b7163f646b762533`.
- User-visible effect: completed the missing platform icon primitive, connected the chat enhancement dock import correctly, repaired the preview typing model for heterogeneous UI records, and removed a malformed serialized newline from the chat composer.
- Modified: `ChatSurface.tsx`, `Icon.tsx`, `StudioSurface.tsx`, `PlatformSurface.tsx`, `navigation.ts`.
- Architecture decision: preview data collections use explicit readonly tuple types where needed, and the platform type guard uses a readonly set over the complete RailMode domain.
- Verification evidence: GitHub Actions run `#690` reports the **TypeScript/frontend build step as success**, including `npm run build --prefix crates/presentation/desktop/frontend`; Rust verification was still running when recorded.
- Unverified checks: final overall CI conclusion, browser visual verification, Windows/Tauri rendering and accessibility audit.
- Rollback point: `19bc9d373dba412d45a021c193268a82159cf526`.
- Next step: complete the final CI run and then perform browser-level verification for navigation and agent workspace flows.


## Cursor + Hermes control-plane depth — 2026-09-24

- Scope: frontend-only continuation of the public Cursor/Hermes capability integration.
- Commits: `e400b26958f926d5143ee2675d8553d6c937d2ac` and `ac892d48b8f520a6918eb104b8808d16ddfb6c5e`.
- User-visible effect: added a dedicated Agent/Plan/Ask/Debug/Bot mode strip, expanded slash-style commands and session controls, centralized persisted navigation across all frontend modes, and added platform surfaces for Plugins, Hooks & Policies, Batch Processing, Learning Loop, Execution Lab, Environments and Source Integrations.
- Architecture decision: chat-specific composition is under `features/chat`; platform-wide capability views are under `features/platform`; navigation remains a single typed registry consumed by rail, command palette and app state.
- Safety/accuracy decision: all newly added surfaces are explicit local/preview UI and do not invent runtime endpoints, provider credentials, cloud execution or messaging delivery.
- Verification evidence: architecture gate and TypeScript/Vite production build passed during CI run `#690`; subsequent run `#693` exposed one ownership-type mismatch and was corrected in `ac892d48b8f520a6918eb104b8808d16ddfb6c5e`; latest global run is `#694`.
- Unverified checks: final global CI conclusion for `ac892d48b8f520a6918eb104b8808d16ddfb6c5e`, browser visual verification, Windows/Tauri rendering and accessibility audit.
- Rollback point: `19bc9d373dba412d45a021c193268a82159cf526`.
- Next step: complete the final CI gate and then proceed to browser-level visual regression coverage.


## Frontend product completion pass — 2026-09-24

- Scope: frontend-only product completion and usability pass.
- Commits included: adaptive panel layout, product administration surfaces, evaluation/notification/presence views, platform data/primitives refactor, feature launcher and task planning.
- User-visible effect: the desktop product now exposes a searchable catalog of 49 visual surfaces across build, operate, configure and integrate planes, with chat execution tracing, session actions, panel focus controls, task tracking and grouped navigation.
- Added visual domains: Sessions, Logs & Traces, Analytics, Webhooks & Events, Credentials metadata, Toolsets, Imports & Migrations, Media Studio, Evaluations, Notifications, Wake Word & Presence and Tasks.
- Architecture decision: the navigation registry is centralized; platform data is separated from rendering; shared platform primitives are reusable; chat-specific execution UI is isolated under `features/chat`.
- UX decision: the primary rail remains compact while the AgentiCOS logo opens a searchable all-features launcher grouped by workflow plane.
- Runtime boundary: all newly introduced controls remain presentation-local/preview until corresponding Rust service contracts are deliberately added.
- Verification evidence: previous CI run `#690` passed the TypeScript/Vite build after the earlier platform hardening; subsequent CI runs are being re-triggered as the frontend grows. Current main verification is tracked separately and must not be inferred from the presence of committed UI code.
- Unverified: current final CI conclusion, browser visual verification, Windows/Tauri rendering, accessibility audit and live backend integration.
- Rollback point: `19bc9d373dba412d45a021c193268a82159cf526`.
- Next step: after the current CI gate, run browser-level visual verification against the desktop frontend before adding live runtime contracts.

## Frontend UX phase — 2026-09-24

- Branch: `frontend/ux-phase-next` (PR #21, target `main`).
- Scope: presentation-only UX expansion; no new backend routes or runtime contracts.
- Added: richer chat composer with slash commands, draft persistence, response format, reasoning/citation toggles and token budget indicator.
- Added: dedicated Agent Profiles studio with behavior, tools, policy and evaluation views.
- Added: dedicated Prompt Lab with library, variables, versions and test views.
- Added: Security Center, Provider Studio, Browser Workspace, Memory Studio, Skills Studio, Tools Studio, Workflow Builder and Artifact Viewer to the broader product surface map.
- Coverage: navigation registry contains 49 surfaces and all 49 currently resolve to a frontend surface.
- Verification: PR checks for TypeScript and Rust are queued as of the branch HEAD; browser CLI verification is unavailable in this environment; Windows/Tauri rendering and live runtime integration remain unverified.
- Runtime boundary: new interactions remain local/preview until a matching runtime contract is intentionally added.
## Workspace orchestration dock — 2026-09-24

- Scope: frontend-only desktop workspace refinement; no Rust/backend contracts changed.
- User-visible effect: added a universal bottom dock available across the desktop shell with Terminal, Problems, Timeline and Output views, plus maximize/restore controls and a compact runtime/mode context.
- Interaction added: `Ctrl+J` toggles the dock; the terminal tab supports local preview commands (`help`, `status`, `clear`) without executing host processes.
- Created:
  - `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/components/WorkspaceDock.tsx`
  - `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/workspace-enhancements.css`
- Modified:
  - `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/App.tsx`
  - `crates/presentation/desktop/frontend/src/main.tsx`
- Deleted: none.
- Preserved: Rust runtime, existing runtime service contracts, existing navigation/features, current implementation-state manifest and historical frontend evidence.
- Architecture decision: the dock is a presentation-layer composition surface and keeps terminal/problem/timeline data explicitly local/preview until matching runtime services exist.
- Verification evidence: source-level integration checks completed for imports, state wiring, keyboard shortcut and dock render path; GitHub Actions will provide the next TypeScript/build evidence.
- Unverified checks: browser visual verification, Windows/Tauri rendering, accessibility audit and live backend integration.
- Rollback point: previous main commit before this operation.
- Next step: inspect the GitHub Actions result for the new frontend commits, then perform browser-level visual verification when a runnable local/deployed frontend is available.
